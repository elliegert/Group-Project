# Data Sources
**1.** The data set named High_Injury_Network.zip explores data from LADOT's High-Injury Network (HIN), which highlights streets with the highest incidences of severe and fatal injury collisions in the City of LA. LADOT's description of the data is below:

  > Even though the HIN represents just 6% of our total street mileage, it accounts for 65% of all deaths and severe injuries involving people walking. Strategic investments along the HIN will have the biggest effect in reducing death and severe injury on our streets. Our methodology draws from the latest 5 years of traffic collision data. The HIN is the guiding document for prioritizing our efforts and the framework for achieving zero traffic deaths by 2025.
