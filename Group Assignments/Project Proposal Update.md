# Proactive Planning - Identifying Common Characterstics of the Built Environment that Make LA Streets Dangerous

[Link to proposal](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Project%20Proposal%20Update.md)

**Roles:**
* Ellie: Organizer, Time keeper, Scheduler, coder, built environment specialist, *more roles to come* 
* Danielle: Transportation background/related research gatherer, coder, visual language consistency overseer, *more roles to come* 

**Status Update**
Overall, we're doing well, maybe a little intimidated. The general team vibe is good, we work well together and have a good balance/are able to help each other understand things. 
* What is working:
    * Brainstorming, coming up with more ideas for our project as we are learning new tools
* What is not working:
    * Nothing is not working (for now)

**Date Update** 

We have some data sets from our first assignments, but definitely need to explore more and gather more data sets. 

* Data we have:
  * [Crosswalks](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/data/Crosswalks.zip)
  * [Los Angeles Collisions 2014 through 2019](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/ladot::los-angeles-collisions-2014through2019/about)
  * [High Injury Network](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/data/High_Injury_Network-shp.zip)
  * [Traffic Counts](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/data/Traffic_Counts.zip)
  * [LA City Census Data - Age](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Census%20Data%20Exploration/acs2019_5yr_B01001_14000US06037293306.geojson)
  * [La City Census Data - Race](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Census%20Data%20Exploration/acs2019_5yr_B03002_14000US06037293306.geojson)

* Data we don't have/need to explore more:
  * Open Streets map (use this for speed, road characteristics?)
  * [Traffic counts](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/data/Traffic_Counts.zip) - need to explore more
  * [Signs](https://github.com/elliegert/Group-Project/blob/main/data/Regulatory_Signs.zip) - need to explore its usefulness
  * Number of lanes 
  * Signalized crossings
  * Bus Routes
  * Bike lanes 

**Concerns**
* Minor Concerns:
  * Translating what we’ve learned in the labs when we have data sets that are slightly different
  * Need to define if we are focusing on deaths or severe injuries as our locations of focus, and how many per location
* Major Concerns:
  * Incorporating two+ different data sets/layering those on top of each othe
  * Defining the parameters (what variables will we use)
    * For example, length of corridors?
  * Figuring out the progression of how the rest of our project should go...what our are next steps and in what order)
  * Scope! What’s realistic given the amount of time we have? 

**Possible Next Steps**
 
1. Pick 5 locations with high traffic fatality rates to use to start to explore street characteristic data as test runs
  2. Explore these 5 characteristics:
    * Speed
    
    * Width/type of road
   
    * Land use
